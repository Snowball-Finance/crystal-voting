Governance V1

Proposals 
- Can propose if you have a high enough percentage of the total possible votes based on outstanding SNOB (100k?)
- Proposals are open for voting for a fixed amount of time
- Proposals that meet the quorum requirements can be executed after the voting period ends
- Proposal statuses include: Active, Defeated, PendingExecution, ReadyForExecution, Executed

Voting
- Can vote yes/no on proposals 
- Deposit SNOB or other approved assets ie PGL (SNOB-AVAX); these are converted to votes
- Timelocks assets until any proposals voters are committed to conclude voting (once you vote, assets are locked for the duration of the vote; advantageous to vote later)
- Can vote for multiple proposals concurrently
- Can withdraw all assets (SNOB, PGL, and earned SNOB from PGL) anytime after all engaged voting periods have concluded
- voting power is quadratic
- you can only vote once per proposal; if you accumulate more assets after voting, you cannot vote with those newly accumulated assets; votes cannot be changed

Quorum
- enough yes votes (simple majority)
- enough votes cast

Voting period
Execution delay
Execution window of X Period until which the proposal is considered vetoed
